# quiz

Hey,

Thanks for viewing the github repo for my QUIZ.
I made this quiz, following a youtube tutorial online by Brian Designs.

<p> You may have noticed that in every folder I have linked a style.css, I too thought I could link it all in one sheet and merge them, but for different pages, I need different variables, While, I do know that there are some not required variables in every style.css file, PLEASE DO NOT MERGE THEM ALL because it will cause huge errors to the quiz!.</p>

Thanks for your support,
