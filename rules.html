<h1> Rules
<p> Hey, Welcome to my quiz game </p>
<p> This is a basic quiz game </p>
</p> The rules are simple </p>
<p> For every right answer you get, you recieve 100 points, for every wrong answer you get, you get 0 points. </p>
<p> You can save you score to our website but for now, no-one else but you will be able to see the scores </p>
<h2> We are working on making it possible for anyone to be able to see your score so we can host competitions of this quiz. </h2>
